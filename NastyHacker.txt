Nasty Hacker Go Away,
Hack Computers Not Today,
Go and fly among the stars,
Take thy hacking off to mars,

See thy not my private files,
From far away, yes, miles and miles,
You need not know what I be doing,
For I dost sense your evil brewing,

FBI shall open up,
and see thou drinking from thy cup
Take thee off far, far away,
For hacking into things today

Nasty Hacker later nerd,
Go fly away just like some bird,
You shouldn't hack, it isn't nice,
Just please dont snoop; don't act like mice.
